  <h2>About Laurie...</h2>

 	<p><Hi! I'm Laurie and I'm learning about HTML development. I work as a technical writer but I would also like to do application development for the web.
 	</p>
 	<p>In June, July and August I plan to attend the Front-End Part-Time Coding Bootcamp. From what I have seen of the curriculum, it promises to be a very intense experience.
 	</p>
 	<p>When I have completed bootcamp, I will be a technical writer who is also a front-end developer which is a unique combination. My manager told me that I will be doing front-end development in combination with my technical writing after I have completed bootcamp. I'm happy to know that I'll be able to use my new technical skills and build on all that I've learned.
 	</p> 
 	<p>My team has just hired a Project Manager and another Javascript applications developer. n nine months we have grown from four people to 12 people, mostly developers. 
 	</p>	
 	<p>On my team now, there are eight Javascript developers, a Project Manager, a Website Designer, me and our manager. We have a great deal of autonomy in how we do our jobs. If we have a good idea, we are expected to bring it to the team and then work to develop it. At first I found this a bit scary. What if nobody likes my ideas??? But when that didn't happen, I developed more confidence and that has made me a better team member.
 	</p>   
	<p>For me, this was a six-month contract assignment that has turned into an 18-month contract assignment. It is one of the most interesting assignments that I've ever had. Who knows how long it will last and where it will take me.
